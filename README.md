2. I think you only need to import requests, import sys, import pprint, and I named my secrets files "config.py".
3. My project grabs data from an API that lists the top 250 television shows using an API key and JSON to store that data as a dictionary. 
   Then, use the same API key on the user ratings API, using the IMDBid of the number 1, 50, 100, and 200 show to print out their user ratings to a data.txt file.
   After that, used the search titles API to get the IMDBid of "Wheel of Time" and then used that IMDBid with the user ratings API to get the user ratings for "Wheel of Time"
   and print it out on the same data.txt file. Finally, print out the list of the shows on the same data.txt file beneath the user ratings data. 
4. I don't believe my project is missing anything at this time.
