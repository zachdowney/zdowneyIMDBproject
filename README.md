2. I don't believe there is any extra directions, just PyCharm.
3. My project grabs data from an API that lists the top 250 television shows using an API key and JSON to store that data as a dictionary. 
   Then, use the same API key on the user ratings API, using the IMDBid of the number 1, 50, 100, and 200 show to print out their user ratings to a data.txt file.
   After that, used the search titles API to get the IMDBid of "Wheel of Time" and then used that IMDBid with the user ratings API to get the user ratings for "Wheel of Time"
   and print it out on the same data.txt file. Finally, print out the list of the shows on the same data.txt file beneath the user ratings data. 
4. My project is missing the second required test, I didn't look at your sample project until I was almost done because I somehow didn't see it 
   or forgot to look. Therefore, I did a few things differently, so I was unable to get the second required test to work because my save_data was different from yours. 
   I could not figure out how to fix that issue. My pytest also says that it's failed, I assume those issues are related.
