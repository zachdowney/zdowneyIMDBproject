2. I think you only need to import requests, import sprintOne, sprintTwo, and sprintThree into test.py and main.py. import sqlite3, requests, secrets, and from typing import Tuple into all three sprint.py files, Run main.py.
3. My project grabs data from different API urls, using an API key. It prints out list of top 250 shows and show user ratings to data.txt file, then it creates a database called 'shows_db.sqlite' and has different functions creating and filling six different tables that go into that database. Then, I have a test file to test all table creating and filling functions and test my function for getting the biggest movers for the movie ratings table. 
4. My database was created and then creates and fills six tables: 'shows', 'movies', 'popular_tv', 'popular_movies', 'show_ratings', 'movie_ratings'. I used DB browser to view the database tables. 
5. I believe I did the create new table and write to table test correctly for four table functions, but I am not sure if that's what you were looking for. Besides that, I was not able to create a test for the show_ratings and movie_ratings tables, I attempted to test the movie_ratings table but I wasn't able to get it. Other than that, I don't know why but I still wasn't able to get the pytest workflows to work unfortunately.
